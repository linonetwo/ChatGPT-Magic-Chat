# Tiddlywiki-NodeJS-Github-Template

Default wiki template for [TidGi-Desktop](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/TidGi-Desktop), an App that can generate template wiki on one-click.

Knowledge base Template, with advanced filter search and faceted data aggregation.

[onetwo.ren/wiki](https://onetwo.ren/wiki) is an example of this template. And [tiddly-gittly.github.io/Tiddlywiki-NodeJS-Github-Template/](https://tiddly-gittly.github.io/Tiddlywiki-NodeJS-Github-Template/) is deployed example of this repo. (There are some optimization to make this demo readonly, and being not downloadable, so its size is almost as small as a GIF picture.)

Downloadable HTML is at [tiddly-gittly.github.io/Tiddlywiki-NodeJS-Github-Template/index-full.html](https://tiddly-gittly.github.io/Tiddlywiki-NodeJS-Github-Template/index-full.html), which contains edit related plugins, and will be slightly bigger (a size of a tiktok video.)

This repo used to contains the wiki backup data and script to start a local wiki server on MacOS on start up. It is now deprecated, and no money to maintain, now [TiddlyGit-Desktop](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/TiddlyGit-Desktop) is preferred. Old version can be found at the [feat/auto-start branch](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/Tiddlywiki-NodeJS-Github-Template/tree/feat/auto-start). Contribution to it is welcome.
